# Migrating to 3.0.0

3.0.0 offers a number of refactoring changes meant to make the code more maintainable and leverage current standards for more readable and semantic code.

- ES6 Modules: Used in source and also available as a distribution format (for modern browsers only; otherwise, use one of the UMD distributions).
- Documentation: Moved to JSDocs and added documentation for public module methods; included online at https://svg-edit.github.io/svgedit/releases/svg-edit-3.0.0/docs/jsdoc/ (or for the latest release, use https://svg-edit.github.io/svgedit/releases/latest/docs/jsdoc/). Thanks, @tetedacier!
- Linting: Move to ESLint, using a derivative of the "standard" convention
- Testing: Though this has only just begun, we have at least added some skeleton support for UI testing
