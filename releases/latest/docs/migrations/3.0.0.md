# Migrating to 3.0.0

## Overview of changes

3.0.0 offers a number of refactoring changes meant to make the code more maintainable and leverage current standards for more readable and semantic code.

- **ES6 Modules**: Use in source, including jQuery plugins, extensions, locales, tests
- **i18n**: Locales now use ES6 Modules and extension locales are now contained in separate files
  relative to the extensions directory (for the sake of true modularity)
- **Documentation**: Moved to JSDocs and added documentation for public module methods; included online at https://svg-edit.github.io/svgedit/releases/svg-edit-3.0.0/docs/jsdoc/ (or for the latest release, use https://svg-edit.github.io/svgedit/releases/latest/docs/jsdoc/).
- **License**: Indicate license types and rename files to reflect
  type; rename/add license file name for jgraduate and screencast to reflect
  type (Apache 2.0)
- **Updates**: jQuery version with imagelib extension and include Mathjax local copy; QUnit
- **Other code refactoring**: `HistoryRecordingService`, migration away from svgcanvas to separate files (e.g., `layer.js`); various clean-up, readability, and consistency changes; avoid inline listeners and styles; more ES5/ES6 usage (e.g., `class`, `includes`, destructuring, object shorthand), prefer `const` and then `let` and place closer to used block; add favicons
<!--
- Refactoring: Move `getStrokedBBox` from `svgcanvas.js` (while keeping an alias) to `svgutils.js` (as `getStrokedBBoxDefaultVisible` to avoid conflict with existing)
- Refactoring (ext-storage): Move locale info to own file imported by the extension (toward modularity; still should be split into separate files by language and *dynamically* imported, but we'll wait for better `import` support to refactor this)
- Refactoring: Remove `uiStrings` contents in svg-editor.js (obtains from locale)
- Refactoring: Remove now unnecessary svgutils do/while resetting of variables
- Refactoring (Testing): Avoid jQuery usage within most test files (defer script,
also in preparation for future switch to ES6 modules for tests)
- Refactoring: Throw Error objects instead of strings (including in jgraduate->jpicker)
-->
- **Linting**: Move to ESLint, using a derivative of the "standard" convention
- **Testing**: Add skeleton support for UI testing with TestCafe; add a draw
  test file; separate JavaScript files out of HTML; use static server; fix
  timing of `all_tests.html` for iframe size; comment out unused jQuery SVG test
  while adding test1 and svgutils_performance_test to all tests page; fix
  inadequate mocking in Path test
- **npm**: SVG-Edit is now published on npm; Add ESLint, uglify, start, and test scripts

<!--
## Breaking changes

There were also the following major breaking changes:

stylesheet specification via @default
- Enhancement: Add `stylesheets` config for modular but parallel
  stylesheet loading with `@default` option for simple
  inclusion/exclusion of defaults (if not going with default).
- Enhancement: Move `config-sample.js` out of `editor` directory
ES6 modules distribution format and module-based
  `svg-editor-es.html` HTML (for modern browsers only; otherwise, use one of
  the UMD distributions or `svg-editor.html` file); modular `stylesheets`
  config for indicating custom stylesheets to load in parallel with built-in;
  make SpinButton plugin independent of svgedit

There were also these minor breaking changes:

- Breaking change: Avoid zoom unless shift key pressed
- Breaking change: Rename config file to `svgedit-config-iife.js` (or
    for the module version, `svgedit-config-es.js`); also expect
    one directory higher; incorporates #207 (@iuyiuy)
- Breaking change: Separate `extIconsPath` from `extPath` (not copying over icons)
- Breaking change: Don't reference `custom.css` in HTML; can instead
  be referenced in JavaScript through the config file (provided in `svgedit-config-sample-iife.js`/`svgedit-config-sample-es.js` as
  `svgedit-custom.css` for better namespacing); incorporates #207 (@iuyiuy)
- Breaking change: Remove minified jgraduate/spinbtn files (minified within Rollup routine)
- Breaking change: Require `new` with `EmbeddedSVGEdit` (allows us to use `class` internally)
- Breaking change: `svgcanvas.setUiStrings` must now be called if not using
  editor in order to get strings (for sake of i18n) (and if using path.js
  alone, must also have its `setUiStrings` called)
- Breaking change (ext-overview-window): Avoid global `overviewWindowGlobals`
- Breaking change (ext-imagelib): Change to object-based encoding for namespacing of
messages (though keep stringifying/parsing ourselves until we remove IE9 support)
- Breaking change: Rename `jquery.js` to `jquery.min.js`
- Breaking change: Remove `scoped` attribute from `style`; it is now deprecated and
obsolete; also move to head (after other stylesheets)
-->
## Summary of fixes

Since 2.8.1, there have been a number of fixes (see the CHANGES file for
more detail). Here is a summary:

- **Localization/18n**: French and German updates; adding simplified Chinese
  to pull-down; bad characters in Persian locale file; fix "lv" locale;
  i18nize `path.js` strings, canvas notifications, and ext-markers
- **Directly user-visible changes** such as imported images with rubberband
  box placement and unattached dragtool, hidden font-size setting, and
  resizing nullifying the stroke, layers panel, zoom centered on cursor
  when scrolled, avoiding when shift key is pressed
- **Keyboard/Command** with keypress double binding and text element
  being triggered by input as well as keyup events, and pasting some lines
  with markers
- **Processing fixes** such as browser feature detection
  (`supportsPathInsertItemBefore` and `supportsPathReplaceItem`), layer fixes,
  multiple selection, cloning of path segments during moving, `convertPath`
  with complex paths, preserving `rx` and `ry` on ellipses to allow disabling
  of rendering, triggering of `svgEditorReady`
- **Browser-specific fixes** impacting Overview panel performance, Multiselect
  with zoom, multiple element selection, `getInsectionList`, pathseg,
  `supportsNativeTransformLists` detection, and save/export, removing identity
  matrices, recover from `tspan` having no `getBBox`
- **Minor fixes** such as broken links or using `https`, adding of ignore
  files, etc.
- **Linting-discovered fixes**: Inadvertent global assignments; bad variable
  scope declarations including within `jquery.jgraduate.js`

## Summary of enhancements

- **Configuration**: Configure text font and stroke
- **Security**: Link placeholder defaults to `https`
- **APIs**: Current zoom level, `addSvgElementFromJson` capabilities,
  ability to set SVG drawings without adding to the undo stack, allow
  extensions to add images without select image dialog; add to methods
  passed to extensions
- **Optimizations**: `getBBox` and loading time; remove unused scripts,
  compress images
- **Logging**: Extension loading error logging
- **Keys/Commands**: Clipboard works across tabs and windows,
- **Publishing options**: npm and `packagist.org`
- **Modules**: ES6 modules distribution format and module-based
  `svg-editor-es.html` HTML (for modern browsers only; otherwise, use one of
  the UMD distributions or `svg-editor.html` file); modular `stylesheets`
  config for indicating custom stylesheets to load in parallel with built-in;
  make SpinButton plugin independent of svgedit
